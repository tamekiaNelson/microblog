To complete this first assignment, do the following:

Read the material for part 1 (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..

Create your own `microblog` repository in your github. Follow best repo practices -- see the Rubric below... (Note: be sure to replace the placeholder text)

├── Pipfile.lock
├── README.md
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── routes.py
└── microblog.py

To submit your work, first create a github repository, and push a TAGGED part 1 to it.
