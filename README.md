# microblog

For our introduction to Flask, we'll be using the Flask Mega Tutorial (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. series, a course designed by Miguel Grinberg.  Each chapter of this series will serve as both a reading, and assignment. Your instructors will guide you through any difficulties throughout the course.

To complete this first assignment, do the following:

Read the material for part 1 (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..

Create your own `microblog` repository in your github. Follow best repo practices -- see the Rubric below... (Note: be sure to replace the placeholder text)

Your directory structure should look like this:

.
├── .gitignore
├── Pipfile
├── Pipfile.lock
├── README.md
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── routes.py
└── microblog.py

To submit your work, first create a github repository, and push a TAGGED part 1 to it.  

Congratulations, you have completed Flask part 1 "Hello World".  To submit your work, copy and paste the tagged github URL into Canvas.
